<h2>Welcome to 'Analyses'!</h2>
<p>
this is a very very old framework for a article archive [website?]</p>
<p>As such, please understand that much of the content in here is created by me..
and thus has much bias and overall old style thinking and thoughts.
This was initiated and created many many years ago. (I think)
</p>
<p>
and so the thoughts in this are just for a past reference, and for basically no reason.
And do NOT reflect my current thinking, thoughts, or opinions.
</p>
<p> also this site is made using a new launcher and darkmode. both of which are not part of 'analyses' originally, but included here A. to test, and B. because it is nice.
</p>
