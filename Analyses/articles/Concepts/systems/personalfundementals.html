Is a protocol for writing, reading, transmitting and &lsquo;holding&rsquo; information.<br /><br />&mdash;<br />A system is a collection of &lsquo;areas&rsquo; that serve a function that gives structure to a purpose.<br />&mdash;<br /><br /><br />Basic Fundamentals :<br /><br />:Should be stable and created to work correctly:<br />Instead of a single error causing the failure of a operation,<br />It should be built around required actions/<br />Or rather, that if the protocol meets basic &lsquo;points&rsquo; or requirements,<br />Then it should work, regardless of other variables.<br /><br />Basically,<br />&ldquo;As long as #variable is ###, and matches #variable, then operation should succeed&rdquo;<br />Perhaps the result maybe have varying success, but the operation should still work.</p>
