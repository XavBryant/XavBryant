<p>Design: Backpack<br />&mdash;<br /><br />I really like backpacks, i guess.<br />I have a briefcase and that thing is amazing,<br />Really.<br />But it will never carry as much s a backpack.<br /><br />-<br /><br />So ive been looking for a very good backpack.<br />And its so hard to find one that has all the features i need, so im here designing one.<br /><br />&mdash;Tactics Backpack&mdash;<br />Its main purpose is to carry just about everything, most for day-to-day use, and enough room to hold extra items, perhaps emergency items, water, and other extra items.<br /><br />I want it designed to carry computer equipment also, having a special inside pouch that is absolutely watertight (or rather more than one pouch)<br />I want to be able to float on it if I crash out of a place (which will never happen) and know my 1-3k$ computer isnt ruined forever.<br /><br />Basic Overview Design:<br />Has similar design as a basic fundemental backpack.<br /><br />Except different also. Its has different compartments for different things.<br />So.<br /><br />The first sleeve, which is the one closest to the uses back, houses a laptop up to 15 (maybe 17?). It has a zipper that has a built in lock, and inside that zipper is a triple layer sealable bag that it goes into (design to come?)</p>
