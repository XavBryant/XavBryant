Dreadnought Tactical Challenge: (DTC)
—

Send in your Dreadnought ideas.
This is to try and be as simplistic and tactical, real life, and logical as possible.

So.

Ship:
Real world here.
You have 3 things of health. (Besides shields which would be a module)
So this is a shieldless build.

However
Armor. And if armor breaks then your hull.
Hull has much less damage resistance.

No self heal. We are being real here, real life, not just ‘hit-points’.
If you have a self-heal, better make it REAL convincing.

Ship Classes:
Into 3 categories.
Corvette - fastest, max 6 weapons
Destroyer - medium
Dreadnought - capital class - super heavy,

Each of these 3 have 3 smaller points, each a single deviation from the main,
IE:
Destroyer-2, a medium destroyer.
Destroyer-1, a light destroyer
Dreadnought-3, a super heavy, capital, capital class dreadnought.

-
Speed scales with these values, as does hull (in the slight deviations)



Every Ship can have 2 primary weapons.
6 modules.
And 6 modules only.

Weapons:
Must scale with ship.
Cant have 40 super amazing weapons and small ship and give it 2mil health.
Aint real.



Modules:
Each module can only have 1 specific purpose and 1 (or a dual-sided/buff 2 action) function.

They must be appropriately given energy consumption, cooldown, duration, and magnitude.
