Strafing: (as a concept)<br>
â€”
<br><br>
--Strafing<br>
Is the ability to be moving in a direction other that what you are facing.<br>
<br>
In a lot of 3D environments strafing is a must for tracking just about anything.<br>
<br>
Without the ability to do so, you would always move towards where you are looking, which for any good position means you break tracking (visual) of the target of subject.<br>
<br>
<br>
--Context of importance:<br>
<br>
Back to video games!! YAY!<br>
<br>
[<br>
Why do people complain about video games? They mimic our world so well, and in ways that we would overlook.<br>
<br> So much is tested in situations that mirror the physical three-dimensional aspect of our world.<br><br>
Video games allow us to test everything in a parralel system that has even more, and those extra things (flying as a example) allows us to enrigh tactics and the importance of positioning, time, efficiency (flying vs walking, and vs stairs, vs elevators) in a variety of situations.<br><br>
what is the goal? how does... [flying] help or hurt? Which should one do?<br> <br>
Elevators better for carrying?<br>
Flying better if being stealthy?<br>
WE CAN TEST THAT!<br>
<br>
anyways, back to article.<br>
]
<br><br>
Strafing is something I do for so many many reasons. Strafing is the lifeblood of positioning (refer to fractured-plot, or right-hand, left-hand, internel connected disconnection).<br>
<br>
Strafe in and out of cover while maintiaing visual of target. Strafe to gain more speed than just moving forward (angle to =average(forward thrust + strafe(side)thrust), strafe to dodge incoming fire (WHILE KEEPING VISUAL OF TARGET), strafe slide, strafe up, list goes on!
<br>
<br>
Lets talk about a more niche application.
<br>
<br>
<br>
--Strafe Mirroring/Inference Optimization<br>
Did you know that you can use strafing to improve your aim? And the reverse (but same logic) applies to the opposing player?(opposing whatever. Movable object, even non-moving object!).<br><br>
If you have a crosshair, (especially a fixed one), mirroring the opposing players movements will yield a lower average % angle difference. Just enough to nudge cross-hairs. Doing the opposite, strafing against or in the opposing direction of the enemy allows you to view further in that direction quicker.<br><br>
that is. If you know the opposing player is moving to YOUR left, you know that you will look to YOUR left to track the target.<br>
Strafing to YOUR RIGHT in that situation allows for enhanced distance from target, which improves tracking.<br>
<br>
<br>
fun fact-
There is a secret sort of inverse aiming math logic that exists. Far away targets require less movement to aim, and thus aiming can be easier. Any movement far away... EVEN IF IT IS THE SAME AMOUNT AT A CLOSER RANGE, is reduced! Even using physical things it is reduced.<br>
Distance*enemy moving = lower average farther away than closer.<br><br>
And while this isnt new at all, applying it here allows you to make those small optimizations even in closer ranges. (as apposed to being "well dur author, just look out the window while driving, nearby stuff seems to move faster than far away stuff... durr!" [im kidding, XD]).<br>
/fun fact<br>
<br>
...and so applying this to those who pass by you allow you to not only maintian a clearer visual on target, but it also more quickly align vectors so that you can easily aim down the center of your screen rather than the edges.<br>
Btw, this is precisely how a turn fight works.<br>
Two opposing players strafing in opposite (but same to themselves) directions, clockwise or counterclockwise is the exact same as a turn-fight (see positioning note).<br><br>
If a player suddenly strafed to the left, you would now be closer to the enemy and your view would naturally end up aiming away from the enemy (just use logic. Aiming at a target moving to the left as you are moving to the left, then move to the right, you are no longer tracking target very well at all!)<br><br>
However...<br>
Sudden movements like this will make the enemy miss, because it's a turn fight, you are supposed to look and be (aim) ahead of the enemy.<br>
Being smart allows you to strafe perhaps even behind the enemy (with some camera movements of course/implied)<br>
Alright, im out of this concept, hehuh, it left me. But this finishes this part of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
--Dodging tactics, the Precog, (still Strafe Inference Optimization)<br>
Very simple. Strafe to the left, and the opposing player will try to fire ahead of you in that direction. (further to the left)<br>
Quickly move to the right, and you may notice that the projectile from the opposing player is now far to the left of you.<br>
With some serious guessing, perhaps instinct playing so many games,<br><br>
you just shift back the left...<br><br>
a projectile screams... to the now far right.. of you...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
you get the idea?<br>
<br>
Inferring the enemy guessing where to lead you allows you to strafe in opposite directions...
even in tight quarters.<br>
Just doing it once (if you are fast) is enough to break whatever pattern was going on.<br>
This is how you can sprint and just work through crazy areas, or rather the front sprint, towards a opposing player.<br>
<br>
(Example: You are short range, they are long range. You are far away but you need to be up-close to be effective, and of-course, to get into a turn fight.)<br>
<br>
And of course, the farther away you are, the more exaggerated the miss, and the more breathing room you have in making your counter strafes work.
<br><br>
Even just random sporadic movement are enough to stop people from taking pot-shots at long ranges, which by-the-way is a counter inference thing.<br>
<br>
quick note.<br>
-- Strafe Inference Interference (pressure)<br>
Its simple. If you know you aren't going to hit an enemy, you wouldn't waste a shot because you are constantly looking for a clear firing solution.<br>
If the enemy can't be hit, the sheer knowledge that in the next half-second he is going to change course and you are going to miss is enough for many to stop firing.<br>
<br>
So SERPENTINE! heh.
<br>
That is of course, when you are sprinting and not when you are strafing an enemy. Strafing often isn't enough for this to work as at the range we are talking about, its back and forth. (we are in medium to close ranges.)
<br>
<br>
Anyways, dance around bullets using smarts.<br>
even just purposefully moving in a direction, as if you are actually heading in that direction can force them to miss.<br>
<br>
So just being mindful of strafing can lead you to dodge shots entirely, or escape to cover where you would otherwise be unable to get to.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-recap<br>
Using Inference you can optimize your strafing to better track a opposing person, increasing relative aiming and allows the forethought of positioning. Strafing with a target decreses the %offset of aiming<br><br>
Strafing backwards can allow you to keep opposing enemy in viewing angles, allowing you to better track and get better perspective (that comes with strafing in the opposite direction of where a target is moving. Thus increasing distance away, increasing aiming solution[just the ability to aim])<br>
Strafing Inference Optimization can also allow you to dodge incoming projectiles and make you harder to track, as the firing solution is predictable.
((Just imagine if you cross hair, when tracking a target, suddenly jerked to the left or right, or just stopped as you were aiming!, in a sense you are doing that to a opposing player)).<br><br>
[Its really just an ability to do the opposite of what a opposing player expects, but applied in the context of strafing, which is a form of positioning]<br>
<br>
<br>
And I think that is it for now. Sorry its a mess to who-ever reads this. Not likely anyone would get to here, but I am disatisfied that the concepts aren't as clean and that this could be communicated in far less words. Inefficiency.
