Time is the instaneous difference in state down a path of the system of everything,
<br><br>
Every instaneous moment.
<br><br>
—
<br><br>
Why start with time?<br>Because, going back with ‘no hesitation’, im restating how relentless each moment is.
<br><br>
Because it is you agaisnt the unknown.
<br><br>
So.<br>
Here is the concept.
<br><br>
—you ahead of time<br>
Concept, simple and clear.

If you act before they do,<br>
Your mind is already ahead of theirs.
<br><br>
The seconds difference between your planning and your action,<br>
Is every second they don’t have to react to what you are about to do, or are doing.
<br><br>
Precious moments,<br>
Catching them surprised.
<br><br>
—
<br><br>
But because of this,<br>
You are pure seconds ahead of them,
<br><br>
If they see you go to move at them,<br>
Then it is every moment they have to counteract what is going on.
<br><br>
—
<br><br>
So being ‘cloaked’,<br>
Moving without a trace is such a vitally important tactic.<br>
To act, and to accomplish things undetected,<br>
<br><br>
Allows for such freedom.<br>
<br><br>
And safety.
<br><br>
—<br>
But i am referring to the short game right now, instead of the general concept of cloaking (which can (soon) be found [here]).<br>
—<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
It is that simple numbers game.
<br><br>
You make a move,<br>
And they don’t,
<br><br>
Every move you make that they don’t react too is the time you are ahead of them.
<br><br>
Because when they do, it is possible you carry the offset.<br>
And when actions happen so so quickly, even a single conventional ‘moment’ can be the difference between effective success, or inadequacy, ineffectiveness, and loss.

Consider the hacker.
<br><br>
[<br>
If someone is inside your system,<br>
If you realize it, and then make (of course) plans to deter the intruder,
<br><br>
Every moment you know, and they do not know that you know,<br>
Is a second that you are now ahead.<br>
<br><br>
And considering if the attacker knew, he could quite easily figure out how to lock you out of the parts of the system, stop you from stopping him, or you getting your files, etc..<br>
