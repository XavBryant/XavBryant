<p>Flash-Courage (to be delete)<br />&mdash;<br /><br />The following:<br />No hesitation,<br />Absolute courage,<br />Instanaeous decision.<br /><br />-<br /><br />When you hold a gun, and some else holds one,<br />You dont think, you react.<br /><br />Its the component of complete reaction that sets those whose blood is ice, and who has the mental edge, the dominance.<br /><br />&mdash;<br /><br />Why is such a concept important?<br />Because it is what is necessary in situations dealing with factors that collapse/invoke a instant death, or a fatal decision.<br /><br />&mdash;<br /><br /><br />Hesistation,<br />Mulling over,<br />Each second is a possibility that they can act before you do.<br /><br />You cannot afford that time.<br /><br /><br />&mdash;mentally<br />Now, there are so many people who boast about having that small time for a act of courage.<br /><br />But make no mistake,<br />The person on a plain far above,<br />Who is truly someone who has a mind, whose mental edge and discernment is that of a razor blade, and focus of a laser,<br /><br />Is someone who had had the forethought to quickly know what to decide.<br />And so its simple for them,<br /><br />Not just simple,<br /><br />Subconscious.<br /><br />They already know the anser, already practiced,<br /><br />The action, that whole opportunity,<br />Is just a side-note to the bigger picutre.<br /><br />&mdash;<br /><br />Those are the people who,<br />When seeing someone fall into the water, old and infirmed, or perhaps a baby,<br />Don&rsquo;t think,<br /><br />The simply jump, and pull it to shore.<br /><br />&mdash;<br /><br />Those who, under stressful situations need to do something, simply do it.<br />It becomes nothing for them, just as if it was opening a door, without hesitation.<br /><br />Those are the people you want on your team,<br />The mental edge, ability, keenness to know when to act, and dont have to make this huge ordeal about<br /><br />&lsquo;Oh how i got over bullying&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Oh my job&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Oh how i have..<br /><br />This and this and this..<br />And this and this...&rsquo;<br /><br /><br />Because while those who display themselves as relativily shallow creatures who think that doing what is ought to have done is somehow indicative of the &lsquo;high&rsquo; quality you are,<br /><br />These guys havent even blinked about it,<br />They are already moving, focusing on the bigger picture,<br /><br />Perhaps noting their progress, but their focus lies ahead,<br />And they simply decide.<br /><br />&mdash;<br /><br />The worth of people who can do that cannot be understated.<br /><br />The people who, as instantaneously as they recognize a situation, act without thinking,<br />With keenness, precision, and effectiveness.<br /><br />Those who run and take the bullet instead of someone else,<br />Who simply glances at a street, sees a car, and a pedestrian,<br />Just run and do it.<br /><br />They dont need to try and figure out<br />&ldquo;Oh what about myself?&rdquo;<br />Taking the long way to realize you should help that person.<br /><br />Their ability to do that mental calculations and decide is just so far above.<br /><br />&mdash;<br /><br />Its the same people who, and while i do not condone violence, for the sake of theoretic,<br /><br />Those who shoot first.<br /><br />They know someone is approaching the door, armed,<br />A intruder,<br /><br />They dont wait for the door to open,<br />Dont wonder &lsquo;what do i do?&rsquo;<br /><br />That sentence where people ask that question,<br />These people have already armed themself, and perhaps if smart, would wait until they start to move door,<br /><br />Slam it open, apprehend attacker.<br /><br />Why?<br />Because those in their household are at stake.<br /><br />&mdash;<br /><br />Another theoretic.<br /><br />You know a person is about to murder everyone in a room,<br />A bomb, trap, etc..<br /><br />You find a gun,<br />You lift it,<br /><br /><br />Your hesitation could be all that person needs to make that effort worthless.<br /><br />You should already know the odds,<br />Already know.<br /><br />These people have no issue instantly implementing a decision.<br /><br />Their focus is so constant, their resolve so deliberate, they already know.<br /><br />They pick up, and fire, three times.<br /><br />They dont hesitate,<br />You shoot first.<br /><br />Not time to go around thinking about yourself,<br /><br />Keep the level-headed cold edge, because in the moment how you react,<br />Every single instantaneous moment,<br /><br />Is the true quality of a persons ability to decide,<br />And is a platinum sign of courage and mental dominance.<br /><br /></p>
