Positioning<br>
â€”
<br><br>
Moving<br>
And staying in a place, or having planned movements.<br>

<br>
The simple ability to plan and move ahead in time.<br>
<br>
--Some Context:<br>
I play a lot of quite fast paced games. Often times where positioning, forward thinking, and self preparation are key to being successful.<br>
<br>
Positioning is so much when it comes to winning and being successful in these areas / contexts.<br>
Positioning has a great many uses and I will try to keep this entire note succinct.<br>
<br>
In most 3D games there are walls or other 'physical' obstacles with which to use as cover.<br>
Using these as cover allow you to increase you quasi-defense, which is a odd way of saying your ability to survive. (It is a connected in concept form of 'metaphysics', figuring out a way to define or quantify non-mathematical decisions in a mathematical way towards its efficiency and effectiveness).<br>
Being positioned behind cover allows you to have a 'safe zone'. Meaning you can hide behind cover, stop damage, and heal/regenerate/ etc...<br>
without this, being stranded in open space, you no longer have the option of 'fleeing', or making a tactical retreat, or the know better run.<br>
This goes along with the saying 'dont get into a situation in which you cannot win',.<br>
<br>
but a better version is this.(imho)<br>
<br>
"Don't let a situation exist in which you cannot win."<br>
<br>
which in a sense means to work hard to be offensively defensive. (good note).<br>
<br>
But back to positioning.<br>
The area in which you are located in context towards the opposing side is aso crucial in your ability to run.<br>
Simply, having the opposing side in-front of and behind you is not good positioning.<br>
Even having cover doesn't mean you can escape either.<br>
A smarter person thinks about what to use as cover.<br>
<br>
"What are the exits? How much cover do I have for the exit itself? In what direction is the exit going? How far is it? Where does that allow me to go?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-- Quasi//Positioning Pressure
<br>
Now for the concept of pseudo or quasi 'pressure'.<br>
Most people in-games wont try to capture a beacon or object against a seemingly more powerful opposing forces.<br>
This is positioning pressure based off power.<br>
In the game, (star conflict) having a guard frigate and a fighter class guard a far away beacon is enough to keep some potential enemy forces at bay from going to take it over.<br>
<br>
further the concept. Even having a small group of allies in between the opposing team and a objective is enough to stop them from going over there.<br>
<br>
in fact, having a guard frigate in an area of the map (if it is within conventional ally territory [refer to the concept that most large maps always divide in an approximate half based on the logical grouping of allies in a lateral plane]), stops people from even going over there.<br>
<br>
Simply.<br> 
<br>
positioning allows you to control possible routes of players, (a cloacked person will go to the outskirts or areas where the opposing side, and even their own side are not), and in the end can allow you to affect other players final positions.<br>
<br>
this concept allows you to passively force the opposing side to attack a objective from a certain angle. (as a example).<br>
<br>
<br>
--By Surprise<br>
The inverse of this is the ability to catch people by surprise.<br>
<br>
The simple way to describe this is to be where the enemy does not expect you to be.<br>
<br>
affect their ability to see you, and/or affect their ability to react to you.<br>
<br>
bait and switch, baiting in general, running, forcing, or other ideas work in this instance.<br>
<br>
Example: In Star Conflict. If a lone interceptor messes with a tackler (a special fighter that can cloak and is made to be advantageous against conventional interceptors) and then attacks a bit (and to further the bait, doesnt run right away, but pretends to put up a bit more of a fight, allowing health to dip a bit) he will run through a pre-planned route that .. in the end .. leaves the enemy tackler away from the position (guarding a objective).
<br>
<br>
Or. A vigilant player sees a fighter going to a far away beacon, he runs to the most likely route for the opposing player and waits until the opposing player is in front of him, in a sense cutting off escape. Then decides to defend the beacon.
<br>
<br>
In a different game, I place mines along places where players would expect to be relatively safe. Non 'hot' zones. And BOOM I get a point.<br>
<br>
In even tighter situations, being above or in a non-logical location can literally be the milliseconds to have the edge in a one-on-one toe-to-toe turn fight. Just rounding a corner with a enemy behind you, and immediately stopping or going upwards completely straight will ghost the player for just a moment. But just a moment is what can decide so so so many battles and situations.<br>
<br>
This further applies to escaping.<br>
<br>
Positioning a good exit to use that has a lot of other cover is a good place to hide in. Often times opposing players will chase you down your escape route, and so you either are fast, or you are smart. Learn to move. Bait and switch (run down the route, move out of the route behind cover and sprint in the opposite direction, perhaps doubling distance between you and NOW opposing teams position 'chasing' after you in the pre-escape route).<br>
<br>
the possibilites are nigh-endless.<br>
<br>
<br>
--Turn Fights
<br>
Turn fights are intense 1 on 1 battles in which two opposing players spin or orbit around each other in close proximity.<br>
it is the enemies movement behind you vs your ability to continue to follow/track the enemy, each doing damage towards each other until a winner is clear or the turn-fight is broken (one attempts to run away).<br>
<br>
These are perhaps the most intensive and quick ones. Everything can get tested in this situation, even slight strafing (when this close) can cause your opponent to miss a shot.<br>
<br>
in the end.<br>
<br>
this is a simple sniper fight. and that means that it is all about counting shots. Typicall turn fights are within the reach of fair. so in the end, if it is even, both players are near the end of health and lose health at the conventional similar rate. No clear pre-determined factors (as they are typically logicall offset. Example: Medium ship, more damage, 2x more health vs smaller ship, smaller hitbox, faster turning (gives that player less time in enemy fire window and more time dealing damage without taking damage).<br>
<br>
and that is the whole point. how to deal more damage vs the damage you take.
<br><br>
in Star Conflict most turn fights are literally 25% health each time... literally counting shots makes the winner oftentimes.
<br>
so having an opponent miss can either allow you to catch up (if you take advantage and land a shot, now making the counting 'even') or put you ahead.
<br>
<br>
So now it has been described... *sighs* in great detail. hehuh. What are some tactics?
<br><br>
In Star Conflict, in many videos I play Marten, and without going into great detail I do the following.
<br><br>
Decide. Commit. Catch a target by surprise. Don't hesitate.
<br><br>
what does that mean?
<br>
it means that before engaging in one, I just make it one (as my ships is adept at it), and I make an alpha strike before engaging in that.
<br>
<br>
ok ok ok. Engage target dealing as much damage as possible before having to go into a turn fight. Thus this gives more 'counts' in your favor, as you have already dealt more damage to the target SIMPLY by attacking without the enemy knowing beforehand. Which (reference the time article) alreadu puts him at a dis-advantage.
<br>
<br>
I usually throw a special missile that slows down the target, giving me the upper hand.
<br>
<br>
Then I start. Rolling sharpens your pitch and allows you to 'catch-up' chasing a enemy. Understanding when you are chasing and when you are being chased (as in when you disappear in your enemies view and thus they cannot hit you for the moment, and vice-versa, and of course, when both are tracking each other) allows you to know when to make adjustments in your turn, perhaps a little more to the right, or to the left.<br>
<br>
Cloaking.<br>
Cloaking during a turn fight can really confuse a target. You track each other, you sharpen, and you are out of view, you cloak, and when they would now conventionally see you (becase each takes sharper turns in order of each other to catch-up) you are gone!
<br>
<br>
This is important because if you cloak while they see you, two things happen. 1. they know you cloaked. 2. they know where you are going.<br>
but to turn around and see literally nothing. They have no reference to fire at (in the hopes of hitting you cloaked). And while perhaps in a couple more moments they will assume you did cloak you are already ahead by time.<br>
<br>
<br>
and then (because my cloak lasts about 5 seconds) I simply regroup, sometimes taking a shield booster (RIGHT after cloaking, any later and it breaks cloak) and trying to position myself once again behind enemy, or rather away from him.
<br>
<br>
for those interested, alpha strikes on unsuspecting enemies when using projectile damagers (weapons, whatever) gives a increase in DPS, ability to hit and many other things.
<br>
<br>
so going to the range of my weapons allows me to repeat what I did the first time, and puts me ahead again. (this maneurver maximizes my 'time' ahead.)
<br>
I do this quickly, of course.
<br>
and speaking of 'of course', this can be used to flee. But running in a turn-fight is precisly counter-intuitive because now they are behind you and you in front. You cant hit them, you can see them (as in your arent facing them) and you cant hit them. You just run for cover.<br>
<br>
sometimes you have to do that, but as you can see... if you do that. do that early. If you can tell you are going to lose...
<br>
<br>
DON'T!, XD. Try and leave and seek a better situation to your favor.
