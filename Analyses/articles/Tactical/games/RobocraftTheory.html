How to Succeed in Robocraft<br><br>
——<br>
<br>
Weapon Theory<br />&mdash;<br />More=better<br>
Getting the max amount of things firing at the same time is crucial to getting the maximum damage output. <br />In order to do that, you must fit a lot of weapons on your ship. That means you must decide whether bigger guns are worth it vs number of hits per second(s)<br>
<br>
Also learning how to position weapons to get the maximum visibility and firing range, without spacing them out too much, making them easy to be hit, and for it to be uniform, and not sacrificing hull.<br>
<br>
Not to mention how you place weapons makes an impact on hitting your target. There are ways to positioning weapons to reduce spread and keep them hitting your target.<br>
<br>
Spread is a big factor, especially when you want many guns shooting at same time, maybe only half of them might hit, and of course, with weapon visibility, maybe only half of them are firing. <br /><br />So you want to build your ship to fire while moving and getting the most hits on your opponent, while your weapons are not too out in the open to be directly fire upon.<br>
<br>
Weapon Formats:<br>
Railgun:<br>
A max of 4 at a time before a loop or whatever. I&rsquo;ve found with the lowest one (Rail Penatrator) that clicking at a repetitive pace actually reduces the spread totally, you can hold down but it will spread like crazy due to the aiming mechanism recalibration for each actual weapon. So you can just keep clicking and do a lot of damage.<br>
<br>
While normally 2 of them is the best, and is actually the max amount on a ship anyways.<br>
<br>
The zoom-in is amazing for hitting flying ships, you can actually shoot out specific guns and specific parts, like wings, and helicopter blades. Very useful, a down ship, is a dead ship. And by down we mean not moving. If you can't maneuver then you are dead. Sitting duck come to mind?<br />
