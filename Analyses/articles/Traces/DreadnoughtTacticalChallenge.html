Dreadnought Tactical Challenge: (DTC)<br>
—<br>
<br>
Send in your Dreadnought ideas.<br>
This is to try and be as simplistic and tactical, real life, and logical as possible.<br>
<br>
So.<br>
<br>
Ship:<br>
Real world here.<br>
You have 3 things of health. (Besides shields which would be a module)<br>
So this is a shieldless build.<br>
<br>
However<br>
Armor. And if armor breaks then your hull.<br>
Hull has much less damage resistance.<br>
<br>
No self heal. We are being real here, real life, not just ‘hit-points’.<br>
If you have a self-heal, better make it REAL convincing.<br>
<br>
Ship Classes:<br>
Into 3 categories.<br>
Corvette - fastest, max 6 weapons<br>
Destroyer - medium<br>
Dreadnought - capital class - super heavy,<br>
<br>
Each of these 3 have 3 smaller points, each a single deviation from the main,<br>
IE:<br>
Destroyer-2, a medium destroyer.<br>
Destroyer-1, a light destroyer<br>
Dreadnought-3, a super heavy, capital, capital class dreadnought.<br>
<br>
-<br>
Speed scales with these values, as does hull (in the slight deviations)<br>
<br>
<br>

Every Ship can have 2 primary weapons.<br>
6 modules.<br>
And 6 modules only.<br>
<br>
Weapons:<br>
Must scale with ship.<br>
Cant have 40 super amazing weapons and small ship and give it 2mil health.<br>
Aint real.<br>
<br>
<br>

Modules:<br>
Each module can only have 1 specific purpose and 1 (or a dual-sided/buff 2 action) function.<br>
<br>
They must be appropriately given energy consumption, cooldown, duration, and magnitude.<br>
