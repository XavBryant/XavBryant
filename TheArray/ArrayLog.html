<h2> 11-23-2020</h2>
<p>Whew!, been gone for a long while, which is funny because no one besides perhaps one other person looks at this.</p>
<p>So uh, fixed some stuff, fixed home page, website is up and running on new github acc, names been changed. Uhh, various random small text fixes.</p>
<p> TODO: I need to actually create and start working on the main site. 'The Array', um. That mainly involves taking pictures of the 4 slides, so like a image of Blender, a VFX shot, a screenshot of some sorta of coding text (i think it will be of the html/css of that exact page, as an easter egg perhaps).
Thankfully this is easy because I just not what filename they are under and simply replace with the correct one. Try and figure out some actual content for the page and not more random images. I do need to make a sub-page of blender .. (and now that I think about it, a sub-subpage for Blender or whatever). Or actually, I don't have to. Just make 'modeling' and 'rendering' and whatnot. </p>
<br>






<h2>10-28-2020</h2>
<p>Finally fixed the dark mode for this page. and thus, fixed 'dark mode' function. I plan on tightening it some more, either today or in the near future. [done today? almost?]</p>
<p>Expect some more updates to the main screen, perhaps more formatting, and hopefully some sort of fix for the selection buttons. Hoping to make them (when hovering) 'focus' (be larger) both directions vertically, and not just down.</p>
<p>BONUS! Imported Montserrat, so everyone can see what I see</p>
<p> Bonus #2 Having css in the document instead of resourcing it (in head(er) part of the html), results in faster processing. And speaking of speed, loading is cleaner in Google Chrome and not Firefox (at least not mine).</p>
<p> Made scrollbar invisible!! </p>
<p>to do: Expand formatting in this to a better font-size, allow list formats, (with smaller font sizes). And add Montserat to the rest of the website, since default font is not that pretty.</p>
<br>

<h2>This is the initial. 10-27-2020</h2>
<p>Initialized "TheArray_Log", updated the main page for "spirin1224.github.io", added some things, cleaned code for the 'article main'. etc...
